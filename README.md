# intractmodelinf
The goal of the `intractmodelinf` package is to provide tools for inference for models with intractable likelihoods using Sequential Monte Carlo Methods. It uses R with integrated C++ code to help computational speed.

This also contains functions to simulate a zombie epidemic under the model described in ["When zombies attack!: Mathematical modelling
of an outbreak of zombie infection"](https://loe.org/images/content/091023/Zombie%20Publication.pdf).

## Installation

This package can be downloaded using the `devtools` as below:
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RaspberryEmma/Intractable-Models-Sim-Study")
```
